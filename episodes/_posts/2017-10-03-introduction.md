Introducing All Things Git, the podcast about Git.
<a href="https://www.edwardthomson.com/">Edward Thomson</a> and
<a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/">Martin Woodward</a> are excited
to talk to the people who build Git, build tools for it and make their
teams successful using it.

We'll bring you an episode every two weeks, talking about the Git version
control system.  We'll get started on October 10, when we talk to

software engineer at GitHub, and he'll talk to us about the all new
GitHub Desktop.
